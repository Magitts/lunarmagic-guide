
LUNAR MAGIC

GUIDE

 



Mightyfine words for the reader




	This is meant to be comprehensive guide for using lunar magic. I'll gather information from programs internal help document and internet. The guide's purpose is to be complete, easy to read document also with explanations to technical terms such as ”VRAM” for those who might not be familiar with such terms. I'll try to gather all the relevant information, links to other guides and info relevant to things in lunar magic.
 The guide is written so that the table of contents can be easily used to find any function found from the program. Titles have been nested in same way as they are in the program.
The language is english so that non finnish speakers too are able to easily read the guide as well as to be practice for myself. The guide is also meant to be used as portfolio piece so that i might more easily find work one day, hopefully.
Some of the text isnt meant to be like this for the final version so if you are reading this line, you are reading the original unedited version of the guide.

Explanations

	Number systems
	Hexadecimals	
	0-F
	1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,A,B,C,D,E,F
	1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16

	More about it in here: https://owlcation.com/stem/Convert-Hex-to-Decimal
	
	Hexadecimals are numbersystem based on 16 rather than 10. On decimals numbers start repeating after 9, meaning you get numbers like 10, 11 → numbers consist of combinations of singular numbers. On hexadecimal, this happens after 16 and to represent it in more familiar 10-system, letters had to be used. 11 in hexadecimal is (when converted to 10-system) 17 and letters appear on 'normal' number 26 (1a). 
	Converting hexadecimals to decimals requires some math and I propably wont go into that here as this is supposed to be short summary for those unfamiliar. The link should have some explanation.

 Numbers like 0x001 are also hexadecimals. 0x just means number after it should be considered to be a hexadecimal
Here is good explanation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9539857/0x00000000-hexadecimal
Amount of numbers in 0x0000 number can also be relevant, as it tells the size of the number in terms of memory. 

		

	Binary
	1,0
	
	1,2,3,4,5
	1,10,11,100,101
	
	Link to more reading: https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html
	On binary, there are just 2 numbers and everything basically revolves around number 2. 1 is 1 but 2 is 10 and 3 is 11. Once you grasp the logic its more simple to understand. Basically the first (rightmost) number in binary number is always either 1 or 0 (1 or 0 in 10-system too), second-rightmost is 2 or 0, third 4 or 0 and so forth, its always increased in power of 2 as you move up the chain. Then to convert back to 10-system, you just add all the ”slots” together and 101 becomes 5 because 100 is 4 and 001 is 1.  



	Terms
		Checksum
		ROM
		Emulator
		Map16
		GFX, exGFX
		





File
	open rom
		Choose the rom you wish to use. This is effectively your working file so make sure 		you have unedited backup before you start editing.
		American and japanese 1.0 supermario world snes roms are supported, also mario all stars + world snes rom is supported.
		If program warns about corrupt checksum, it means ROM is corrupt or it has been modified with another (non lunar magic) program. This might cause serious problems later as there could be malicious code inserted to such rom or the rom might behave in unexpected ways. 
	open level number
		Opens one of the mario levels. There are multiple levels in ROM from 0-0x1FF(0-??), most are empty though.
	level address
		Opens exact ROM offset you specify. This is meant to be used to open levels that do not have pointer in the pointer table. You propably wont need to use this unless you are trying to do something clever.
	save level to rom
		Save your work and modify the ROM file you are using. 
	open next/previous level in rom
		Cycles forward or backward in list of levels in the ROM. 
	open level from file
		Opens previously created mario level file that contains all of the stuff that the level consists of. Its meant to be easy way to export singular levels. Note that file does not contain actual grapgics (GFX), use the EXTRACT GFX FILES to get those. It also doesnt contain Map16 data or shared palettes or any other level independent data. Lunar magic versions older than 1.6 work a bit differently so make sure you are using the latest version.
	save level to file
	Do the thing mentioned above and export the current level into its own file.
	graphics
		setup tile editor
			You can use external editor to edit stuff. It will also save the settings you specify to your computers registry. You have to use specific programs meant to edit tiles, palettes and such. For example: tile layer pro https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/108/.
		extract/insert GFX from rom
		Creates GFX file from rom for tile editor program to edit. It will create graphics folder into your working directory(where the ROM file you are editing is) if it doesnt exist already.
Inserting the file will replace the GFX files within the rom with one you specify.
		Extract / insert exGFX
		Ex in exGFX means ”extra” as in something that does not exist in original ROM files. These are additional graphics you might want to add to your romhack. If you want to use these you have to configure SUPER GFX BYPASS setting in LEVEL menu. More about that later.(laita linkki kohtaan)
	pallettes	
		extract/import level palette to file
			Extract or replace the palette file from the ROM. Make sure the editor you are using is set to load 256 color entries. This one will use only the pallette of the level you have currently open.
		extract insert shared pallettes to rom
		This one will use all of the shared palettes in the rom to single file. The file will not include custom level palettes as they are stored with the level itself. 
Shared pallettes are, more specifically -katso myöhemmin mitä kirjoittaa tähän lisää-

	levels
		Export/import multiple levels to file
		
Export/import multiple levels from the rom to level file. ”Only export modified levels” option lets you choose if you want to export all of the levels (0x200), creating 512 small files.
		analyze resources in levels

Map16 Tile Usage Report (Non-covered, Non-conditional)

Tile 0 count: 37BA
	Levels: 2, 1C, BE, C0-C1, C6, CE, F7, 102, 11C, 127, 12D, 1D5
Tile 1 count: 89
	Levels: 116, 118, 1BF, 1C2-1C3
Tile 2 count: 423
	Levels: 1C, C0, C6, CE, F7, 11C, 12D, 1D5
Tile 3 count: 351
	Levels: 116, 118, 1BF, 1C2-1C3

Excrept from the log of the unmodified rom level
So the level analyzer basically counts everything there is in the ROM. On the log you can see mentions of tiles, if you look at 16x16 tile map editor, tile 0 is water and water appears first time on levels 2 and 1C on default supermario world? Could this be a Coincidence? I think not. So the log tells you exactly how many things of each type there are in ROM and on which levels. It also counts it in hexadecimal for fun and profit.
According to the sacred texts that is lunar magic help file, it doesnt count tiles that have been covered by other tiles or otherwise have conditions that dont make the tile appear immidiately so it counts only what you can actually see. It also wont analyze bossfight levels or anything else lunarmagic cant render. In addition to tiles it will count sprites, which music tracks are used in which levels and which graphic files are used where.
		clear original level data area
		
	This is meant for making things nicer for 3rd party asm hacks (asm stands for assembly, more about it here https://supermarioworld.fandom.com/wiki/ASM_Hack). According to the sacred texts, there are some sections that wont still be available for use, like chocolate island 2, entrances to castles and other stuff that werent even used in original game. Those have been marked with RATS(Rom-allocaton-tag-system) 
(term explained here https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=102891 . It basically means marked as reserved, to prevent conflicts. Its used to prevent patches and tools from mistaking parts of the rom as free space for them to use.)


		export multiple levels to image files
		
It will create image of your levels in png format. This one will create image for every single level.
		export level to image file
		Same as before, but only for level currently open. 
		
	emulator
	Now, despite what someone might claim, EMULATORS ARE COMPLETELY LEGAL TO DOWNLOAD AND USE. Here is a link to further reading about the subject: https://www.howtogeek.com/262758/is-downloading-retro-video-game-roms-ever-legal/
(Do note that just because I link something here doesnt mean its the only or even the best source of information, use your own judgement.)
If you are looking for emulator, snes9x is the one I used for purposes of this guide. You can find one from this site: https://www.romhacking.net/
		run rom in emulator
		You dont have to specify which emulator to use every time, just the first time if you havent set up its path yet. Just use the path to exe file of the emulator.
		setup emulator
		Here you can modify the emulator path setup if you want to. Its same window that is used to setup the emulator at the first time.
		
		run/stop internal emulator
		You need lmsw.dll to use lunar magics internal emulator. It needs to be in same folder as lunar magic itself. You can download the dll here https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=20746

		pause, mute
		You can pause the emulator while testing your maps. This will let you scroll around the level. The tool creator was so nice that he added a mute so you dont have to listen to your banger soundtracks while editing your levels.
		swap f4/ctrl+f4
		Lets you choose if you want to press f4 or ctrl AND f4 to run the internal emulator. 
	expand rom 2-8mb
	The program automatically expands the ROM as needed so you dont have to use this unless you specifically want to have extra space for something. 
If you want to use SA-1(...) in your rom to have more than 4MB extra space you (have to do some stuff, i'll get to it some later time.)
	Memory is precious commodity in romhacks so dont waste it. You can expand the roms capacity only so much. Maybe i'll add a section about memory saving tricks.
	Restore
	Restore points are basically your saves for the romhack design process. Do remember to make restore points every now and again or you might find your hard work undone when something causes rom to become unopenable. In case your rom actually becomes unopenable you can get to the restore list by taking any other supermario rom, giving it same filename as one you want to access. You can also just open some other smw rom and browse  to your restore point.
Incremental restore points save space as they will track only the changes that have been done. Full restore point is always the entire thing.
		create full restore point
	As explained above.
		restore from restore point
	As explained above.
		create ips file from rom
	This will allow you to create patches for your ROM. Its basically portable restoration point you can give to your friends so they dont have to download your entire romhack everytime you want to add yet another bowser to your level.
		apply ips file to rom
	Here you can apply the patch you made to your romhack. You can also use separate patching program, like Lunar IPS you can find from here https://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/. 
	scan rom
		This will show you quickly some information about your rom. Before you jump to conclusions there are no rats in your computer invading your rom as their sovereign nation, plotting your demise and building their devilish machines to conquer us all. Here is quite good explanation about what RAT means:  https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=102891

Sources:
Some parts might be directly from the source materials which would make those concerned about plagiarization very mad if not properly referenced. For the purposes of getting the guide done i'll write the guide first and worry about references later if at all. I will use direct quotations if its more useful than trying to reword something myself. I will also add my own comments, suggestions and analyzes. 
Here is the list of sources where i have looked for information, maybe i'll remember to add it all. I wont add anything that doesnt relate directly to romhacks here, you have to look for those links from where they are first referenced.
(Do note that just because I link something here doesnt mean its the only or even the best source of information, use your own judgement.)
